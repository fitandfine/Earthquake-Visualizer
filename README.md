# üåç Real-Time Earthquake Visualizer ‚Äì Production

A **client-side, interactive web application** that visualizes global earthquakes in real-time using live **USGS GeoJSON feeds**.  
Built with **vanilla JavaScript**, **Leaflet.js**, **Leaflet.MarkerCluster**, and **Leaflet.heat**, this tool allows users to explore earthquakes by magnitude, depth, location, and timeframe, with enhanced interactivity and performance.

## ‚ú® Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Live Earthquake Feed**     | Fetches latest quakes from [USGS GeoJSON API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) every 60 seconds. |
| **Marker Clustering**        | Efficiently renders hundreds of earthquake points using `leaflet.markercluster`. |
| **Heatmap Overlay**          | Optional `leaflet.heat` layer visualizes intensity and density of seismic activity. |
| **Magnitude & Depth Filters**| Users can filter earthquakes by minimum magnitude and maximum depth.       |
| **Time Frame Selection**     | Choose between last hour, last day, or last week for the displayed data.   |
| **Search by Place**          | Real-time search box filters earthquakes by location name.                  |
| **Rich Popups**              | Displays magnitude, depth, coordinates, UTC time, and a direct USGS link. |
| **Depth Color Coding**       | Circle markers are color-coded: teal‚Üígold‚Üíorange‚Üípurple based on depth.   |
| **Auto-Fit Bounds**          | Map automatically zooms to show all relevant earthquakes.                  |
| **Responsive Layout**        | Sidebar collapses gracefully on smaller screens for mobile users.          |
| **Legend**                   | Visual depth legend helps interpret color-coded markers.                   |
| **Auto-Refresh**             | Updates earthquake data every 60 seconds without page reload.              |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Handling Logic

1. **Fetch Data**
   - Dynamically constructs the USGS GeoJSON feed URL based on selected timeframe (`all_hour`, `all_day`, `all_week`).
   - Fetches JSON asynchronously using `fetch()`.

2. **Filter & Process**
   - Filters earthquakes by user-defined minimum magnitude, maximum depth, and place name.
   - Extracts coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) and relevant properties (`mag`, `depth`, `place`, `time`, `url`).

3. **Map Visualization**
   - **Cluster Layer:** Uses `L.markerClusterGroup()` to render circle markers efficiently.
   - **Heat Layer:** Uses `L.heatLayer()` to create heat intensity map proportional to magnitude.
   - **Depth-based color coding:** Circle fill color based on depth thresholds.
   - **Magnitude-based radius scaling:** Ensures larger quakes are visually prominent.
   - **Popups:** Include formatted time, magnitude, depth, coordinates, and USGS link.
   - **Auto-fit bounds:** Zooms map to show all filtered earthquakes.

4. **User Interaction**
   - **Filters:** Inputs dynamically update displayed earthquakes.
   - **Search:** Filters by case-insensitive place name.
   - **Toggle Heatmap:** Add/remove heat overlay.
   - **Auto-refresh:** Data updates every 60 seconds without page reload.

## üé® User Interface

- **Sidebar:** Filters, search box, legend, statistics, and heatmap toggle.
- **Map Area:** Full-screen interactive Leaflet map with clustering and heatmap.
- **Popups:** Rich info display with external links.
- **Responsive Design:** Grid layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens.

## üìà Data Source

- **Primary Source:** [USGS Earthquake Feeds](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
  - GeoJSON feeds updated in real-time for hourly, daily, and weekly earthquakes.
- **Map Tiles:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) ‚Äì free and open-source.

## üöÄ Current Limitations / Next Steps for Production

1. **Error Handling**
   - Currently logs fetch errors to console; user-facing notifications could improve UX.

2. **Performance**
   - For extremely dense datasets (thousands of earthquakes), clustering performance may degrade slightly.

3. **Caching / Throttling**
   - Currently fetches every 60 seconds; caching responses could reduce unnecessary API calls.

4. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels are not fully implemented.

5. **Analytics / Logging**
   - No analytics or logging of user interactions or errors.

6. **Security**
   - This is a client-only app; future production versions may require HTTPS enforcement, CSP, and input sanitization for safety.

7. **Deployment**
   - For true production readiness:
     - Serve via HTTPS-enabled hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or custom server).
     - Minify and bundle JS/CSS for faster load times.
     - Optionally, add service workers for offline support and caching.
